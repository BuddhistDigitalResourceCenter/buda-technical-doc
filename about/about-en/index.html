    <h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
<h2 id="brrc">BRRC</h2>
<p>BDRC is partnered with Zhejiang University in China to build out the Buddhist Universal Digital Archive (BUDA) and the Sanskrit and Chinese Buddhist Library Network. Zhejiang University’s Dr. Huanhuan He has formed BRRC，the Buddhist Resources and Research Center (佛教資源與研究中心), which will take as its founding program the development of the Buddhist Universal Digital Archive and particularly the Sanskrit and Chinese Buddhist Library Network. Zhejiang University has a strong technology focus, particularly in the fields of digital libraries and digital humanities, and the institutional leadership is very supportive of SCBLN and the BUDA initiative. The Zhejiang University partnership acts as a nexus of the collaborative scholarly network for BDRC.</p>
<p>The digital data created through the program will be available for academic and public access. In addition, all materials digitized and metadata records created as part of the Sanskrit and Chinese Buddhist Library program will be stored in a long-term preservation program at Harvard University Digital Repository Service, thus ensuring their accessibility for current and future generations.</p>
<h2 id="bdrc">BDRC</h2>
<p>The Buddhist Digital Resource Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Joining digital technology with scholarship, BDRC ensures that the ancient wisdom and cultural treasures of the Buddhist literary tradition are not lost, but are made available for future generations.</p>
<p>BDRC was founded as Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center in 1999 by E. Gene Smith (1936-2010). For the past seventeen years, we have sought out, digitized, cataloged and archived nearly 12 million pages of culturally significant works in Tibetan, Sanskrit and Mongolian languages, while developing cutting-edge technology for their lasting preservation and far-reaching accessibility.</p>
<p>As the result of this effort, we have raised the Tibetan literary corpus, once critically endangered, to a high level of preservation. All our text and metadata resources are stored in a long-term preservation program at Harvard University Digital Repository Service. Our library has become the premier library resource serving an international community of academic scholars, religious leaders, Tibetan scholars, as well as translators, publishers and the interested public. TBRC’s impact on the field of Tibetan studies in the past seventeen years is significant.</p>
<p>Now, at the request of our Board, as well as our partners and collaborators in the Buddhist studies field, we have expanded our mission to include the preservation and dissemination of the many Buddhist literary traditions that, due to shifting social and environmental factors, remain in a precarious position. A broadened preservation mandate for the Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC) was thus established in order to bring the expertise and resources of its seventeen year history to bear in this most pressing preservation task. As of July, 2016, the official name of TBRC has been changed to BDRC to reflect our expanded mission.</p>
